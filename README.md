The repository is organized in two main folders: Notebooks and Datasets. Notebooks contains the python scripts we exploited for realizing the experiments depicted in the paper. Datasets, the data we used. 

Every single folder is structured in 5 different subfolders, representing the 5 different datasets we used in our experiments: Movielens 100K, Douban, Flixster, Yahoo Music and our Synthetic Dataset.
